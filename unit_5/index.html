	<p>Empowering creative journeys through authentic connection</p>

	<p>Hi, I'm Rachel! My dream is to help bring your greatest visions to life. As a professional marketing specialist, I understand the power of a strong first impression. Since my agency-coached modeling journey began in 2015, my greatest passion has become connection. Through modeling, I've been able to create beautiful harmony between my marketing and branding knowledge and creative drive. As my journey began in Los Angeles, I am grateful to call Michigan home and my hub for modeling endeavors! I can't wait to work with you. &hearts; </p>
